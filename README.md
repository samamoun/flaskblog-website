# Sarah Al Mamoun's Flask Blog üë©‚Äçüíª

I am creating a Full-Featured Web Application built with the Flask framework in Python 
for my web development class at **Concordia University**.

This application includes a user management system that can register the users, and once they are registered they can login, logout, and make small blog updates. 

Building this application helped me better understand Flask while dealing with databases, accepting and validating user input from (register/ login) forms, and saving data onto backend file systems.

I used an SQLite database to store real users and data during development.
